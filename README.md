# The Resume Project at Udacity
This project is a webpage that shows my work history, where I've worked, and other information based on data provided by a JSON object.  

This repository consists of:

* **index.html**: The main HTML document. Contains links to all of the CSS and JS resources needed to render the resume, including resumeBuilder.js.
* **js/helper.js**: Contains helper code needed to format the resume and build the map. It also has a few function shells for additional functionality. 
* **js/resumeBuilder.js**: This file is empty. You should write your code here.
* **js/jQuery.js**: The jQuery library.
* **css/style.css**: Contains all of the CSS needed to style the page.
* **README.md**: 
* and some images in the images directory.

##Getting Started
Open The index.html file in a browser to display display the web page.
